## Hi, I'm Yan ! ðŸ‘‹
- Just finished my internship at team MFX (Inria). I was working on the Printer-to-Lua project to enable users to create their own machine profiles for the IceSL Slicer.
- No personal project at hand for now.
- I'm currently a freshman at French engineering school ENSEEIHT, studying computer science.
